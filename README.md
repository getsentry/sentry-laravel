This is the official Laravel SDK for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)

## Getting Started

The installation step below work on the latest versions of the Laravel framework (8.x, 9.x and 10.x).

For other Laravel or Lumen versions see:

- [Laravel 8.x & 9.x & 10.x](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/)
- [Laravel 6.x & 7.x](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/other-versions/laravel6-7/)
- [Laravel 5.x](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/other-versions/laravel5/)
- [Laravel 4.x](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/other-versions/laravel4/)
- [Lumen](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/other-versions/lumen/)

### Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Enable capturing unhandled exception to report to Sentry by making the following change to your `App/Exceptions/Handler.php`:

```php {filename:App/Exceptions/Handler.php}
use Sentry\Laravel\Integration;

public function register(): void
{
    $this->reportable(function (Throwable $e) {
        Integration::captureUnhandledException($e);
    });
}
```

> Alternatively, you can configure Sentry in your [Laravel Log Channel](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/usage/#log-channels), allowing you to log `info` and `debug` as well.

### Configure

Configure the Sentry DSN with this command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:publish --dsn=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

It creates the config file (`config/sentry.php`) and adds the `DSN` to your `.env` file.

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

### Usage

```php
use function Sentry\captureException;

try {
    $this->functionFailsForSure();
} catch (\Throwable $exception) {
    captureException($exception);
}
```
